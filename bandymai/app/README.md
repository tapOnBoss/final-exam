## About

[Brain Gain](https://braingain.vercel.app/) is a study tool that I developed to learn and apply my knowledge of the MERN stack. I used [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) as a reference to build the app and implement similar functionalities. Brain Gain allows users to create and share flashcards and tests. It also provides a simple user interface for a seamless study experience.
